# SummerProject
This program performs anomaly detection and root cause analysis on a CSV dataset (raw, time-series laboratory and industrial sensor-based data). It performs intelligent preprocessing and feature classification, identifies anomalies using Z-scores and the isolation forest algorithm, identifies root causes and automatically generates a PDF report.
